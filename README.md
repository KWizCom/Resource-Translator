# Resource-Translator

A utility that allows you to quickly translate .NET resource files.

The resource translator was originally written as a utility that enabled customers to quickly translate any KWizCom add-on for SharePoint 2010/2013 to any required language. But the utility can be used to translate most .NET resource files. The resource translator makes use of Microsoft Translation Services available on the Windows Azure Marketplace.
